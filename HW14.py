#1. Create a variable that asks the user for an integer and an empty intger variable.
x = 1
y = int(input("Give me an integer:"))

#2. Create a loop with a range from 1 to the number the user input.

#3. Use the loop to find the factorial of that number. A factorial of a number is that number multiplied
#by every number before it until you reach 1.
#For example: 5! is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120
for k in range(1, y+1):
    x *= k
#4. Print the factorial.
print("The factorial of your number is: ", end="")
print(x)
